# Minecraft python puzzle game mod 
This is a Python-mod for minecraft that adds a puzzle game. I made it using mcpi library and RaspberryJamMod on minecraft. You can test it in your Minecraft world after doing 1-5 steps in https://www.instructables.com/Python-coding-for-Minecraft/ Then add 'blockdoku.py' file and 'details' folder in 'mcpipy' folder. Go in any Minecraft world and write a command /py blockdoku in chat. Game started! You can use mouse right click to take and place details, 'q' - for change theme.
